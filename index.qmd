# Introduction

The **Modified Attitudes on Psychedelics Questionnaire (MAPQ)** is a psychometric instrument adapted from the original *Attitudes on Psychedelics Questionnaire (APQ)* developed by Dr. Zuljevi in Croatia. This adaptation was specifically designed for and validated within a cohort of **Canadian residents**, reflecting the unique cultural and regulatory landscape of the region.

## Project Scope

This scientific project encompasses two primary analytical pillars:

1.  **Psychometric Validation**: Rigorous assessment of the MAPQ's internal structure using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and McDonald's Omega reliability estimates.
2.  **Causal Inference**: Application of **Double Machine Learning (DML)** to estimate causal effects within the dataset, specifically investigating the impact of demographic factors (e.g., Gender) on Knowledge Sharing (KS) behaviors, controlling for high-dimensional confounding.

## Security & Reproducibility

This project adheres to strict **DevSecOps** principles:
*   **Data Privacy**: All sensitive data handling is secured via environment-variable encryption logic.
*   **Reproducibility**: The entire workflow is version-controlled and containerized for deployment on Posit Connect.
*   **Scientific Rigor**: Analysis uses advanced statistical packages (`psych`, `DoubleML`, `lavaan`) to ensure robust results.

## Data Source

The data is sourced from the `MAPQ_TKARONTO-3.xlsx` dataset, containing responses from the Canadian cohort. The analysis focuses on the `MAPQII` and `MAPQ + KS + KnAcqS` datasheets.
