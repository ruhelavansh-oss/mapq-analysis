# Contributor Statement

This project, including the conceptualization, data analysis, and technical implementation of the Modified APQ (MAPQ) pipeline, was **solely contributed** by Vansh Singh Ruhela.

# About the MAPQ

The **Modified Attitudes on Psychedelics Questionnaire (MAPQ)** is a psychometric instrument adapted from the European **APQ**.

## Adaptation Context

This version of the questionnaire was specifically adapted and validated for a cohort of **Canadian residents**. The modifications account for:

-   Regional cultural nuances regarding psychedelic substances.
-   The specific regulatory environment in Canada (e.g., medical access programs).
-   Linguistic norms of the target population.

# Technical Implementation

This website and analysis pipeline were built using a secure, reproducible stack:

-   **Quarto**: For scientific publishing and reproducibility.
-   **R & Python**: For statistical analysis (Psych, DoubleML).
-   **Posit Connect**: For secure deployment and hosting.
-   **DevSecOps**: Utilization of environment variables and encrypted secrets for data safety.
